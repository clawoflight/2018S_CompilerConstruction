/* We will want to design a clean api, as much as possible should be
 * file-static.
 *
 * Idea for adding entries: add a method on scopes that takes an ast declaration
 * and
 * - adds an entry to the scope if it is new
 * - returns an error if the id was already declared
 * - Impls SSA if necessary (I think we will need to do that - but then
 *   we need to rename all subsequent calls?)
 *
 * We will also need to add a method on scopes to look up declarations,
 *
 * and a method that takes an ast call_expr, id_expr or arr_subscr_expr and
 * - looks up the corresponding declaration (taking shadowing into account!!!)
 * - links the ast expression to the corresponding symtab entry (howtf should we
 *   do that!? give ID a type enum and allow it to contain a pointer to
 *   mCc_symtab_entry?)
 * - returns an error if the id was not declared first
 *
 * SYMTAB BUILDING:
 * Will be done using a specialized visitor that only handles the cases that it
 * needs. E.g. every declaration will trigger an #mCc_symtab_scope_add_decl.
 * This means the visitor will need to keep track of it's scope! Does that work?
 * Or should we just use a long nested loop abomination to walk the ast?
 *
 * The AST visitor will need to open a scope for each function declaration (for
 * the params) and another for each body.
